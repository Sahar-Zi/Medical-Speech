- Prensent the CSV file, and one audio example.
- EDA ideas:

Data Summary:
Start by loading your CSV file and understanding its structure.
Check for any missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
Understand the distribution of each variable, especially the "overall quality" variable, which seems to be the target variable.

Distribution of Overall Quality:
Plot the distribution of overall quality ratings to understand the distribution of ratings.
Check if the distribution is balanced or skewed towards certain ratings.

File Distribution:
Explore the distribution of files across different categories such as writer_id and speaker_id.
Plot histograms or bar charts to visualize the distribution of files per writer or speaker.

Audio File Analysis:
If feasible, consider extracting features from audio files such as duration, sampling rate, etc., and explore their distributions.
You can also check for any correlations between these audio features and the overall quality ratings.

Correlation Analysis:
Investigate correlations between different variables, especially between features and the target variable (overall quality).
Use correlation matrices and scatter plots to visualize relationships.

Time Series Analysis (if applicable):
If the data includes timestamps or any time-related information, you can perform time series analysis to explore trends or patterns over time.

Visualization of Audio Files:
Consider randomly selecting a few audio files and visualize their waveforms or spectrograms to get a visual understanding of the audio data.
Plotting spectrograms can help in understanding the frequency content and characteristics of audio files.

Quality Distribution Across Categories:
Explore if there are any patterns in the quality ratings across different categories like writer_id or speaker_id.
Plot box plots or violin plots to visualize the distribution of quality ratings within each category.

Class Imbalance Check:
Check for class imbalances in the overall quality ratings, especially if you plan to build a predictive model.
If imbalances exist, consider strategies like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during modeling.

Data Augmentation Potential:
Depending on the context, consider whether there are opportunities for data augmentation, such as adding noise or applying transformations to the audio files, to enhance the diversity of the dataset.
